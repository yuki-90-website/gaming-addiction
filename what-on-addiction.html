            <p>
                Games can control our mind if you addict. You can ask how come. The answer is very simple with an example.
                Many children don't listen to our parents and ask them to give the mobile or computer to play them.
                If they didn't give, you shout them so that their mind can get upset. We dont observe our surroundings 
                when we play a game. Our eyes get strained and we get eye problem if we play or watch screening for a long time.
